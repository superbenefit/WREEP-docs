# Membership

Windfall Protocol Community membership is open to the public and free for everyone. Members get access to community discussion spaces, digital collectibles and other perks. Retrospective benefits may also be granted to active community members as the project matures into its fundraising and implementation phases.

If you don't want to join the community, you're still invited to attend our bi-weekly community calls and receive email updates by signing up to [our community calendar](https://lu.ma/wreep).

## How to Join

This community is managed by SuperBenefit's Windfall Protocol web3 Core Team, who reserve the right to change eligibility requirements, remove inactive members and otherwise alter the terms of membership as needed during the project.

### Role Badges

Members will be issued non-transferable role badges upon joining the community. Badges can be used to access private community spaces and signal your consent to receive collectible participation rewards.

Badges are issued through [Hats Protocol](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/) and may be renounced at any time using the [Hats App](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/30?hatId=30.1.1.2). You can also ask a team member to remove your badge. Renouncing your membership badge will revoke your membership privileges, but _not_ your collectibles.
