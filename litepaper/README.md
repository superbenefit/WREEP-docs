# 📃 Litepaper

The Windfall Protocol is a decentralized protocol created to address multi-party coordination challenges faced by place-based energy efficiency initiatives.

* [Litepaper Highlights](./#litepaper-highlights)
* [**Request for Feedback**](./#request-for-feedback)

Designed for real-world implementation as part of the [Canada Greener Homes](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/energy-efficiency/homes/canada-greener-homes-initiative/canada-greener-homes-grant/canada-greener-homes-grant/23441) initiative, the protocol will facilitate energy usage data sharing and efficiency retrofits for 200,000 homes in Durham Region, Canada.&#x20;

The design of the protocol is described in its Litepaper, created by Jessica Zartler and Jeff Emmett of BlockScience ([credits](./#credits)), informed by representatives from community groups, municipal agencies and utility companies serving the region.
