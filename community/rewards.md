# Rewards

Members can earn rewards through their participation in discussions and community activities.

These **non-financial** rewards are meant to recognize those who bring value to the community by interacting with others, sharing knowledge, attending events and engaging in a variety of other ways.

## Community Token ($ENERGY)

Community Members will be rewarded for their participation via the [$ENERGY token](rewards.md). Members can opt in to receive these tokens by filling out the [Sign-Up Form](https://wreep.deform.cc/community-signup/).

* Completing onboarding quests
* Attending community calls and other events
* Participating in the Windfall Protocol discord channels
* Sharing ideas, networking and inviting others to the community

[$ENERGY](rewards.md) is used to unlock free digital collectibles and exclusive experiences. It also provides an onchain contribution graph to enable future utility drops like special recognition, contribution opportunities, governance weight or other non-financial benefits. It is intended to have **zero monetary value** (even in the future).

<summary>What can I do with $ENERGY?</summary>

$ENERGY builds up in your wallet and acts as a reputation metric. It demonstrates that you have been making valuable contributions to the community.

A higher amount of $ENERGY in your wallet can qualify you to unlock community features and play a larger role in the project community as it evolves.

The more $ENERGY you have the more votes you will have on community proposals on things like design directions for the project. The most engaged members of the community earn the right to have a greater say in the direction of the community (and by extension, the protocol).

You can also use your $ENERGY tokens to unlock commemorative NFTs that may be launched to celebrate milestones in this project.

<summary>How does the $ENERGY token work?</summary>

There is a fixed supply of 1 million $ENERGY tokens.

These are allocated to your wallet and should not be sold or given to anyone else.

When you want to unlock access to a feature of the community, the system will query your wallet and ascertain whether you have the requisite $ENERGY tokens to qualify for the access you are requesting.

When you vote on community proposals the system will query your wallet and allow you to vote with the $ENERGY tokens that are in your wallet.

The $ENERGY token is not designed to have a monetary value or be a financial asset.
