  For those who are new to crypto/web3, here are some simple resources to gain a
  foundation of knowledge about the concepts and tools that we will be using in
  this project.

# An Overview of Web3

A basic knowledge of crypto/web3 concepts will help in two main ways. Firstly it will help you understand and engage with the different crypto/web3 tools and practices that we will be using to coordinate community participation in this project. But more importantly, having a basic understanding of the core concepts of crypto/web will help you understand and engage with the core idea of the energy labelling protocol and of all the possible innovations that can stem from it.&#x20;

In [Web3 For 2030](https://undp.db.team/web3/) (a project we created for the UNDP), we cover the fundamentals of crypto/web3, how to understand its evolution - from speculative beginnings, to new technology paradigm, and how it can create positive social and environmental impact.&#x20;

For those new to crypto/web3 wanting to gain a quick overview of the subject we recommend working through the following sections in [Web3 For 2030](https://undp.db.team/web3/):

* A brief history of the web
* Cryptographic trust
* Early landscape

To go deeper into how crypto/web3 is emerging as a technological paradigm work through the section titled [_How to think about technological change._](https://undp.db.team/web3/)

Finally, the section entitled[ _Web3 opportunities_](https://undp.db.team/web3/) will help you understand the novel mechanisms and dynamics at play. These will help you make sense of the transformational potential of the WREEP project.  &#x20;

The rest of the document relates to the UNDP and the SDGs more specifically. But do refer to the section on [_Technology Risks_](https://undp.db.team/web3/) to understand the reality of things like the energy consumption of blockchains or privacy and security issues if these are of particular concern.&#x20;
