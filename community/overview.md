# WREEP Project Community

In addition to its core scope of work, the WREEP project will gather a digital community to promote the exploration and adoption of emerging coordination tools for place-based energy efficiency initiatives.

The WREEP Community consists of project stewards, stakeholders, web3 citizens and builders, as well as interested parties from across the wider energy efficiency/retrofit industry globally. This community will follow the project and contribute to its development by generating signals, sharing ideas and advocating for emerging coordination tools for improving energy efficiency in the built environment. &#x20;

## Community Guides

* [An Overview of web3](guides/web3.md)
* [Creating a web3 Wallet](guides/wallets.md)

How-to guides are created by the community upon request. Visit the [Support](../support.md) page to learn how to request a new article.

## Membership

The WREEP Community is open to all aligned individuals who wish to learn about and discuss regenerative, place-based coordination tooling.

Members will receive an NFT membership badge granting access to real-time chat channels, signaling ("voting") spaces, participation rewards and other WREEP Community benefits.
