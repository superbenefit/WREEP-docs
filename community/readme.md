# Community Overview

The WREEP Community consists of project stewards, stakeholders, web3 citizens and builders, as well as interested organisations and individuals from across the wider energy efficiency/retrofit industry globally. This community will follow the project and contribute to its development. This includes the  early phases of scoping and publishing the NFT Litepaper, through to implementation of the protocol in the Durham region of Canada, and on to broader implementation and innovation opportunities internationally. &#x20;

## Membership

Community Members are responsible for generating feedback and signals (such as approval or dissent) for various aspects and stages of the protocol during its development. Its continuing purpose will be to contribute to the development of decentralized coordination tooling, services, infrastructure, and incentives around the protocol in the context of place-based energy and efficiency retrofit initiatives.

Members are invited to attend welcome events and monthly Town Hall calls, submit feedback and author/vote on community proposals.
