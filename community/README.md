# WREEP Project Community

In addition to its core scope of work, the WREEP project will gather a digital community to promote the exploration and adoption of emerging coordination tools for place-based energy efficiency initiatives.

This community will follow the project and contribute to its development by generating signals, sharing ideas and advocating for emerging coordination tools for improving energy efficiency in the built environment. &#x20;
