# ðŸ“ƒ Litepaper

The Windfall Protocol is a decentralized protocol created to address multi-party coordination challenges faced by place-based energy efficiency initiatives.

Designed for real-world implementation as part of the [Canada Greener Homes](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/energy-efficiency/homes/canada-greener-homes-initiative/canada-greener-homes-grant/canada-greener-homes-grant/23441) initiative, the protocol will facilitate energy usage data sharing and efficiency retrofits for 200,000 homes in Durham Region, Canada.&#x20;

The design of the protocol is described in its Litepaper, created by Jessica Zartler and Jeff Emmet of BlockScience ([credits](litepaper.md#credits)), informed by representatives from community groups, municipal agencies and utility companies serving the region.

## Highlights & Summary

We recognize that some readers may find the full 43-page litepaper overwhelming, or may not have time to read the whole document. We encourage you to check out the [Executive Summary](litepaper.md#executive-summary) to gauge your interest.&#x20;

In the coming days, the Windfall Protocol Community will summarize key areas of the litepaper to provide a more accessible reading experience. We welcome your [questions and feedback](litepaper.md#request-for-feedback), regardless of your level of familiarity with the litepaper.

### Executive summary

> Canada needs systemic shifts in energy efficiency retrofit programs in order to accelerate the national transition towards our net-zero emission targets by 2050. Homes and buildings account for nearly one-fifth of Canadaâ€™s carbon footprint, but at current retrofit rates it will take 142 years to transition residential buildings, and 71 years for commercial buildings. Yet our transition to a zero carbon economy is needed within the next 26 years - preferably within the next decade, given the speed of the unfolding climate crisis.&#x20;
>
> The Windfall Protocol Research Group has completed a five-month study with funding from Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) to survey this landscape from a systems perspective and identify design considerations for a new layer of multi-stakeholder coordination and shared digital infrastructure. Partners including Windfall Ecology Centre, Possibilian, BlockScience, and SuperBenefit are researching and developing an open-source blockchain-based protocol to facilitate energy efficiency labelling and data sharing for residential and commercial buildings to accelerate retrofit adoption dubbed the Windfall Protocol. This paper outlines a high level conceptual architecture and technical considerations, as well as a planned pilot in Durham Region.
>
> The Windfall Protocol aims to address many of the gaps that exist between stakeholder groups in current building energy efficiency subsidy programs. For participants, it can reduce complexity of accessing information and retrofits, and offers new incentive pathways. For regulators and incentive providers, the protocol offers opportunities for smart and targeted incentives, improved data flows, and actionable net-zero strategies. This multi-stakeholder digital infrastructure could be leveraged for large-scale transformation of energy markets, open new avenues to finance energy efficiency retrofits, and supercharge the coordinative capacities and incentives needed to drive the volume of retrofits required for net-zero.&#x20;
>
> In addition to digital, technical, and economic innovation, the protocol will also require multi-stakeholder governance and representation in design choices and trade off decisions with social, technical, economic, and environmental impacts. As part of these efforts, the Windfall Protocol Research Group is also convening a consortium of stakeholders to solicit feedback and engage in discussions on further development of the program and the protocol it aims to produce.
>
> This paper informs the next phase of research and development for the Windfall Protocol Research Group in defining the Windfall Protocol Program - including a pilot implementation in the Durham municipality of Ontario, Canada. The goal is to create an open-source energy efficiency retrofit protocol with the steering capacities required to guide our systems on a more resilient and regenerative environmental and economic trajectory.
