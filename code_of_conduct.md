# Code of Conduct

We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

## Platform Guidelines

We use Discord and GiHub to host community spaces. Use of these platforms requires adherence to the Discord [terms](https://discord.com/terms) and [guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines), as well as the GitHub [terms of service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service). These should be assumed to be in effect in the WREEP community as well.

Our Discord space is hosted on the [SuperBenefit](https://superbenefit.org/) server. Please read and adhere to all SuperBenefit server rules and respect our shared spaces.

## Confidentiality

Please keep what's said in Discord confidential. Don't repeat, quote, or otherwise share things said here without the affirmative consent of the speaker(s).

Be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public. While we expect members to honor the confidentiality of this space, we cannot guarantee that they will do so--nor can we guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.

**All communication on GitHub is public**. Please keep in mind that anything you post or commit to our GitHub repositories will be visible to anyone on the internet.

## Harassment

Harassment includes:

Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment. Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop. Threats of violence Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm Deliberate intimidation Sustained disruption of discussion Unwelcome sexual attention Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease Publication of non-harassing private communication Note that colorful language (swear words, in all of their various forms) is intentionally not on this list. Our Discord server is not a puritanical space. There is an assumption that we are all adults and as a result we don't shy away from use of language that might not be appropriate in all workplaces. As long as colorful language doesn't veer into harassment, as defined above, it is not in violation of this Code of Conduct.

## Reporting

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the WREEP Core Team using the contact info displayed in the #wreep-info channel. They'll respond as promptly as they can.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this server and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.
