# Windfall Residential Energy Efficiency Protocol (WREEP) Project
<!--It's a working title.-->

Energy usage in residential buildings is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.

Governments at all levels have long recognized energy efficiency retrofits as effective programs that simultaneously achieve environment, employment, and civic awareness goals. Unlocking their full potential however is a massive multi-party coordination challenge across contractors, vendors, utility providers, and owners and occupantsâ€¦ a challenge further complicated by the scope and timing of benefits of efficiency investments extending well beyond an owner or occupants purchase decisions.

The purpose of the WREEP project is to design a blockchain-based protocol that can help address these multi-party coordination challenges.

## **Development Phases**

WREEP is split across 3 different phases with 3 distinct groups who contribute in different ways.&#x20;

1. **Development of the Litepaper** - scoping the design of the protocol in collaboration with stakeholders from across all aspects of the residential retrofit space.
2. **Implementation of the protocol** - delivering a pilot of the protocol for the Durham region in Canada.
3. **Broader ecosystem development** - facilitating a wider community of interested parties to contribute ideas, funding and projects that innovate on the pilot version of the protocol.

## **Contributing Groups**

1. **Project Stewardship group** - funders and facilitators of the initial phase of the project (see below).

* [Windfall Ecology Centre](https://windfallcentre.ca/)
* [Natural Resources Canada](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/home)
* [Possbilian](https://possibilian.xyz/)
* [SuperBenefit](https://superbenefit.org/)
* [BlockScience](https://block.science/)

1. **Pilot Stakeholder Group** - organisations and individuals who directly contribute insights, research and perspectives to the development of the Litepaper (phase 1) and to the implementation of the pilot (phase 2).&#x20;
2. **Project Community** - the wider community, which includes groups 1 & 2 (above), but also organisations and individuals from around the world and across sectors who have an interest in this project and its wider applications beyond the Litepaper and the specific implementation of the initial pilot project. This group will also explore possibilities for raising funds to implement the protocol as well as to innovate on opportunities that it might create.&#x20;
