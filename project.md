# Windfall Residential Energy Efficiency Protocol (WREEP) Project
<!--It's a working title.-->

Energy usage in residential buildings is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.

Governments at all levels have long recognized energy efficiency retrofits as effective programs that simultaneously achieve environment, employment, and civic awareness goals. Unlocking their full potential however is a massive multi-party coordination challenge across contractors, vendors, utility providers, and owners and occupantsâ€¦ a challenge further complicated by the scope and timing of benefits of efficiency investments extending well beyond an owner or occupants purchase decisions.

The purpose of the WREEP project is to design a blockchain-based protocol that can help address these multi-party coordination challenges.

## **Development Phases**

WREEP is split across 3 different phases with 3 distinct groups who contribute in different ways.&#x20;

1. **Development of the Litepaper** - scoping the design of the protocol in collaboration with stakeholders from across all aspects of the residential retrofit space.
2. **Implementation of the protocol** - delivering a pilot of the protocol for the Durham region in Canada.
3. **Broader ecosystem development** - facilitating a wider community of interested parties to contribute ideas, funding and projects that innovate on the pilot version of the protocol.

## Project Stewards

Project Stewards are delegates of the projects contributing organizations who oversee delivery of the funded project. Groups represented by the Project Stewards include:

* [Windfall Ecology Centre](https://windfallcentre.ca/)
* [Natural Resources Canada](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/home)
* [Possbilian](https://possibilian.xyz/)
* [SuperBenefit](https://superbenefit.org/)
* [BlockScience](https://block.science/)

The stewardship group is responsible for contributing to growth of project, community, and stakeholder groups. To ensure operational alignment with the terms of the initial proposal, Stewards may exercise collective veto power on any community proposals over the course of the project (until March 31st, 2024).
