# Community

In addition to its [core scope of work](project.md), the Windfall Protocol project is gathering a digital community to learn about the protocol and help to inform its design.

This Windfall Protocol Community will follow the project through its design phase and contribute to its development by generating signals and sharing ideas & feedback. We also hope to serve as a gathering place for industry experts, web3 builders and others to network and discuss various approaches to place-based resource coordination challenges.

Community spaces and events will be hosted by **WP Web3 Core Team** at **SuperBenefit DAO** during the initial design project and litepaper publication.

## Membership

The Windfall Protocol Community is open to all aligned individuals who wish to learn about and discuss regenerative, place-based coordination tooling.
