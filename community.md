# ðŸŒ³ Community

Designed with composability and interoperability in mind, the Windfall Protocol is intended to provide its greatest utility when operating within ecosystems of complementary technologies and social systems. Discovering and integrating these tools is crucial to the long-term success of both the protocol and its intended users.&#x20;

In addition to its [core scope of work](litepaper.md), the Windfall Protocol project is gathering a digital community of local representatives, industry experts and web3 builders to inform the protocol's design and identify potential relationships with ecosystem peers.&#x20;

With your help, we hope to answer these key questions:&#x20;

* How might the protocol adapt to serve other jurisdictions, projects and use cases?
* What other types of place-based resource coordination challenges could be addressed using this type of protocol?&#x20;

## Community Calls&#x20;

Projects updates and real-time discussions are held during bi-weekly community calls. These events are open to the public and all community members are encouraged to attend.&#x20;

Each call will include Q\&A and/or open discussion periods, and members who contribute to the discussion will receive additional participation rewards.&#x20;

* [Events Calendar ](https://lu.ma/wreep)

Calls are hosted by the [Protocol Research Group](litepaper.md) on the [SuperBenefit Discord server](https://lu.ma/wreep) and may be recorded. Recordings of some past calls are included below.

We use [rewards](rewards.md) to track participation in the community. Rewards are accumulated by members using their Ethereum wallets, creating a publicly visible, privacy-preserving record of members' participation. We may then use rewards balances to distribute impact attestations, governance authority or other perks as the project evolves.&#x20;

Community members may opt-in to receive rewards by completing the [sign-up form](https://wreep.deform.cc/community-signup/). You can earn rewards by participating in a variety of ways, including:&#x20;
