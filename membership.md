# Membership

Windfall Protocol Community membership is open to the public and free for everyone. Members get access to community discussion spaces, digital collectibles and other perks. Retrospective benefits may also be granted to active community members as the project matures into its fundraising and implementation phases.&#x20;

If you don't want to join the community, you're still invited to [participate in the chat](https://discord.com/invite/6mDepqjgh2), attend our bi-weekly community calls and receive email updates by signing up to our [community calendar](https://lu.ma/wreep).

***

## How to Join

Membership is available to all aligned members of the web3 community who consent to the [code of conduct](code\_of\_conduct.md) and [privacy policy](privacy\_policy.md).

Participation by token-enabled community members is a key performance metric used by the protocol research group. In order to track our progress toward these goals, we request that members provide us with a small amount of personal information (namely their public wallet address) in an anonymized and privacy-preserving manner. Check out our [Privacy Policy](privacy\_policy.md) for more information.

We've created options to streamline this process for both community members and the project team: [Community Quests](membership.md#community-quests) and the [Signup Form](membership.md#signup-form).&#x20;

### Signup Form

You can join the community using the [Signup Form](https://wreep.deform.cc/community-signup/) if you prefer not to use the self-service [Discord Quests](membership.md#option-1-community-quests). Follow these steps to submit your application:

1. Create an Ethereum Wallet (see [Creating a web3 Wallet](community/guides/wallets.md))
2. Join the [SuperBenefit Discord Server](https://discord.gg/6mDepqjgh2)
3. Fill out the [Signup Form](https://wreep.deform.cc/community-signup)
4. Wait for a member of the project team to process your application.

Once you've been issued a role badge, a team member will ping you in the chat and welcome you to the community. Be sure to join the [SuperBenefit Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/6mDepqjgh2) for access.&#x20;

### Community Quests

You can also join the community by completing self-service onboarding quests in our Discord chat space. Quests allow prospective members to use bot interactions to submit their wallet address and perform several other important actions within the community (like introducing yourself in the chat and reading these docs).

Follow these instructions to join the Windfall Protocol Community using our self-service onboarding quests:&#x20;

1. Join the [SuperBenefit Discord Server](https://discord.gg/6mDepqjgh2)
2. Navigate to the [#wp-quests](https://discord.com/invite/ZxEXyVqnSm) channel and use the /quests command to see a list of available quests
3. Complete enough quests to earn 100 XP and attain Level 2
4. Wait for a member of the team to issue your role badge

### Membership Badges

Members will be issued non-transferable role badges upon joining the community. Badges can be used to access private community spaces and signal your consent to receive collectible participation rewards.

Badges are issued through [Hats Protocol](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/) and may be renounced at any time using the [Hats App](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/30?hatId=30.1.1.2). You can also ask a team member to remove your badge for you. Renouncing your membership badge will revoke your membership privileges, but _not_ your collectibles and rewards.

Check out the [Hats Protocol Docs](https://docs.hatsprotocol.xyz/using-hats/essentials-for-hat-wearers) for more information about your role badge.
