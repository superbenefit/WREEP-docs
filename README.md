## [Project Overview](project/)

Energy usage in residential buildings is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.&#x20;

Governments at all levels have long recognized energy efficiency retrofits as effective programs that simultaneously achieve environment, employment, and civic awareness goals. Unlocking their full potential however is a massive multi-party coordination challenge across contractors, vendors, utility providers, and owners and occupantsâ€¦ a challenge further complicated by the scope and timing of benefits of efficiency investments extending well beyond an owner or occupants purchase decisions.

The purpose of the WREEP project is to design a blockchain-based protocol that can help address these multi-party coordination challenges.

**The protocol will:**

1. Hold verifiable proofs of energy audits and completed retrofits.
2. Allow owners and occupants to share energy data to verify efficiency outcomes.
3. Allow incentive providers to design and deploy targeted and performance based incentives.

\
**The WREEP project will:**&#x20;

* Design the Protocol:
  * Establish a **Pilot Stakeholder Group**. Coordinate subject matter experts, utility providers and other local stakeholders to inform the design of the protocol.&#x20;
  * Develop a protocol design "Litepaper", outlining a highlevel technical design for the protocol  based on a pilot implementation in [Durham Region](https://www.durham.ca/en/index.aspx), Canada.&#x20;
* Implement the pilot - develop the protocol for use in Durham Region &#x20;
* Engage a wider **Project Community -** these are organizations and individuals from around the world and across sectors, including web3 builders who have an interest in this project and its wider applications beyond the Litepaper and the implementation of the initial pilot project.

## [WREEP Community](community/)

Community Members are sustainable energy industry organizations and individuals, web3 citizens and builders and other interested parties who follow the project. The goal of the community is to contribute ideas and resources to the development and implementation of the energy efficiency protocol itself, as well as suggestion and developing innovation on top of the protocol.&#x20;
