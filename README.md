# WREEP Community Docs

Community documentation for the Windfall Residential Energy Efficiency Protocol (WREEP) project.

## [WREEP Project](project.md)

WREEP is a collaborative effort to design a decentralized protocol addressing multi-party coordination challenges faced by place-based energy efficiency initiatives.

The goal of this project is to create an energy efficiency labeling protocol design (litepaper) to augment residential energy retrofit efforts currently underway as part of the Canada Greener Homes Initiative.
