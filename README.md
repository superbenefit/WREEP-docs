## [Project Overview](/project/readme.md)

The purpose of the WREEP project is to design a protocol for a dynamic blockchain asset which can be used in subsequent work to develop and test blockchain-based residential energy efficiency labeling and data systems for use in a portal for homeowners and occupants.

- Coordinate subject matter experts, utility providers and local stakeholders to inform the development of the protocol.
- Develop a proposed labeling protocol design (litepaper) for residential buildings to be used by their owners and occupants.
- Engage and anonymously identify the wider community of web3 builders who may implement and extend the protocol by issuing blockchain assets to their wallets as a reward for participation.

## [WREEP Community](/community/readme.md)

Community Members are web3 citizens, builders and other interested parties who follow the project and contribute to the development of decentralized coordination tooling, services, infrastructure, and incentives for place-based energy and efficiency initiatives.
