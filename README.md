# Windfall Residential Energy Efficiency Project

An NFT-enabled protocol for energy efficiency labeling in the built environment.

## Project Overview

WREEP is a project to design a protocol for a dynamic NFT which can be used in subsequent work to develop and test blockchain-based residential energy efficiency labeling and data systems for use in a portal for homeowners and occupants.

This project is initially focused on designing the energy labeling protocol, and may expand its scope to include funding and implementing the protocol with a pilot group. Our current goals are to:

- Design and implement a community stakeholder engagement strategy to gather requirements for a dNFT protocol, considering needs of Indigenous, low-income, and other marginalized user/resource groups.
- Publish the results of the protocol design in a litepaper for public review and open-source development.
- Explore possibilities for raising funds to implement the published protocol with select regions and consumers.

## WREEP Community

The WREEP Community is responsible for generating feedback and signals (such as approval or dissent) for various aspects and stages of the protocol during its development. Its continuing purpose will be contributing to the development of decentralized coordination tooling, services, infrastructure, and incentives for place-based energy and efficiency initiatives.

### Community Members

Community Members are web3 citizens, builders and other interested parties who follow the project and contribute to the development of decentralized coordination tooling, services, infrastructure, and incentives for place-based energy and efficiency initiatives.

Members are invited to attend welcome events and monthly Town Hall calls, submit feedback and author/vote on community proposals.

### Project Stewards

Project Stewards are delegates of the projects contributing organizations who oversee delivery of the funded project. Groups represented by the Project Stewards include:

- [Windfall Ecology Centre](https://windfallcentre.ca/)
- [Natural Resources Canada](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/home)
- [Possbilian](https://possibilian.xyz/)
- [SuperBenefit](https://superbenefit.org/)
- [BlockScience](https://block.science/)

The stewardship group is responsible for contributing to growth of project, community, and stakeholder groups. To ensure operational alignment with the terms of the initial proposal, Stewards may exercise collective veto power on any community proposals over the course of the project (until March 31st, 2024).

Stewards will attend monthly meetings via Zoom. Meeting minutes will be included in this repository as they are available.

### Pilot Stakeholders

Pilot Stakeholders are local representatives and subject matter experts who inform the design of the protocol and lite-paper. Groups and cohorts represented by the Pilot Stakeholders include:

- [Windfall Ecology Centre](https://windfallcentre.ca/)
- [Natural Resources Canada](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/home)

The stakeholder group is responsible for giving feedback and participating in discussions and research activities to inform the design of the energy labeling protocol. Stakeholders may signal dissent or support for contributions to the protocol litepaper to ensure that outputs of this project serve the needs of communities, utilities and other user cohorts.

Stakeholders receive periodic emails from the project containing information related to feedback campaigns, signal proposals and general project updates. They also participate in research/discovery discussion sessions with our engineering partners.

### ⚡ Participation Rewards

Participation in this project will be tracked using [Sourcecred](https://github.com/superbenefit/sourcecred). Participants will be awarded our community token, $ENERGY (⚡), to acknowledge their engagement and contributions.

$ENERGY's purpose is to facilitate the possibility of retrospective utility drops such as community privileges, contribution opportunities, governance weight, or other perks. The token has not yet been minted and is intended to have zero monetary value.
