## [Project Overview](project/)

The purpose of the WREEP project is to design a protocol for a dynamic blockchain asset which can be used in subsequent work to develop and test blockchain-based residential energy efficiency labeling and data systems for use in a portal for homeowners and occupants.

* Coordinate subject matter experts, utility providers and local stakeholders to inform the development of the protocol.
* Develop a proposed labeling protocol design (litepaper) for residential buildings to be used by their owners and occupants.
* Engage and anonymously identify the wider community of web3 builders who may implement and extend the protocol by issuing blockchain assets to their wallets as a reward for participation.

## [WREEP Community](community/)

Community Members are sustainable energy industry organisations and individuals, web3 citizens and builders and other interested parties who follow the project. The goal of the community is to contribute ideas and resources to the development and implementation of the energy efficiency protocol itself, as well as innovation on top of the protocol for new initiatives. &#x20;
