# Windfall Protocol

The goal of this project is to create an energy efficiency labeling protocol design ([litepaper](litepaper.md)) to augment residential energy retrofit efforts currently underway as part of the Canada Greener Homes Initiative.

### Windfall Protocol's Mission

Energy usage in residential buildings is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.

Governments at all levels have long recognized energy efficiency retrofits as effective programs that simultaneously achieve environment, employment, and civic awareness goals. Unlocking their full potential however is a massive multi-party coordination challenge across contractors, vendors, utility providers, and owners and occupantsâ€¦ a challenge further complicated by the scope and timing of benefits of efficiency investments extending well beyond an owner or occupants purchase decisions.

A central purpose of the Windfall Protocol project is to design a blockchain-enabled protocol that can help address these multi-party coordination challenges.

### Project Roadmap

Development of the Windfall Protocol will happen in several phases, covering the design and development of the protocol to implementation and ecosystem development.&#x20;

1. [**Development of the Litepaper**](litepaper.md) - scoping the design of the protocol in collaboration with stakeholders from across all aspects of the residential retrofit space.
2. [**Implementation of the protocol**](./#durham-region-pilot) - delivering a pilot of the protocol for the Durham region in Canada.
3. [**Broader ecosystem development**](community.md) - facilitating a wider community of interested parties to contribute ideas, funding and projects that innovate on the pilot version of the protocol.

While the Research Group's formal engagement ended in March 2024, collection of feedback and onchain signaling of community participation will continue through the beginning of the implementation phase.

## Durham Region Pilot

The Windfall Protocol is designed for a proposed real-world pilot implementation. Coordinated by [Windfall Ecology Centre](https://windfallcentre.ca/), the pilot will serve [Durham Region](https://www.durham.ca/en/index.aspx) in Southern Ontario, Canada, providing owner/occupant controlled building data ledgers to 200,000 homes as part of [Canada's Greener Homes Initiative](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/energy-efficiency/homes/canada-greener-homes-initiative/24831).

Organizations and community representatives participating in the Pilot Stakeholder group include:

* [Durham Region](https://www.durham.ca/en/index.aspx)
* [Indigenous Aware](https://www.indigenousaware.com/)
* [Alectra Utilities](https://alectrautilities.com/)
* [Clean Air Partnership](https://www.cleanairpartnership.org/)
* [Volta Research](https://voltaresearch.org/)
* [Toronto and Region Conservation Authority](https://trca.ca/)
* [Oshawa Power](https://www.oshawapower.ca/)
* [Six Nations of the Grand River](https://www.sixnations.ca/)

### Stakeholder Discussions

To inform the development of the litepaper, the [Protocol Research Group](./#protocol-research-group) held a series of discussions with key stakeholders in the proposed Durham Region pilot. These discussions included an overview of the protocol design at key points in its development and provided an open space for questions and discussion among the Research and Stakeholder groups.

Recordings and other information related to these discussions can be found below. Direct feedback and questions from stakeholders, as well as their identities, have been redacted to ensure an open environment for discussion.
