# Project Overview

WREEP is a project to design a protocol for a dynamic NFT which can be used in subsequent work to develop and test blockchain-based residential energy efficiency labeling and data systems for use in a portal for homeowners and occupants.

This project is initially focused on designing the energy labeling protocol, and may expand its scope to include funding and implementing the protocol with a pilot group. Our current goals are to:

- Design and implement a community stakeholder engagement strategy to gather requirements for a dNFT protocol, considering needs of Indigenous, low-income, and other marginalized user/resource groups.
- Publish the results of the protocol design in a litepaper for public review and open-source development.
- Explore possibilities for raising funds to implement the published protocol with select regions and consumers.

## Project Stewards

Project Stewards are delegates of the projects contributing organizations who oversee delivery of the funded project. Groups represented by the Project Stewards include:

- [Windfall Ecology Centre](https://windfallcentre.ca/)
- [Natural Resources Canada](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/home)
- [Possbilian](https://possibilian.xyz/)
- [SuperBenefit](https://superbenefit.org/)
- [BlockScience](https://block.science/)

The stewardship group is responsible for contributing to growth of project, community, and stakeholder groups. To ensure operational alignment with the terms of the initial proposal, Stewards may exercise collective veto power on any community proposals over the course of the project (until March 31st, 2024).

Stewards will attend monthly meetings via Zoom. Meeting minutes will be included in this repository as they are available.
