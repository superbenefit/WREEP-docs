# Pilot Overview

The end-term goal of the WREEP Project is to pilot the proposed energy labeling protocol in [Durham Region](https://www.durham.ca/en/index.aspx), Canada.

The proposed protocol will be used to augment Durham Region's ongoing residential energy retrofit efforts, requiring coordination among owners, occupants, utility providers, local governments and other entities. The WREEP project will accomplish this by convening a Pilot Stakeholder group to gather important information and signals of consent or dissent at key stages.

## Pilot Stakeholders

Development of the protocol and litepaper is informed by the Pilot Stakeholder group. These local representatives and subject matter experts collaborate with Project Stewards to ensure that the protocol addresses the needs and limitations of real-world users. Groups and communities represented by the Pilot Stakeholders include:

* [Windfall Ecology Centre](https://windfallcentre.ca/)
* [Durham Region](https://www.durham.ca/en/index.aspx)

The stakeholder group is responsible for giving feedback and participating in discussions and research activities to inform the design of the energy labeling protocol. Stakeholders may signal dissent or support for contributions to the protocol litepaper to ensure that outputs of this project serve the needs of communities, utilities and other user cohorts.

Stakeholders receive periodic emails from the project containing information related to feedback campaigns, signal proposals and general project updates. They also participate in research/discovery discussion sessions with our engineering partners.
